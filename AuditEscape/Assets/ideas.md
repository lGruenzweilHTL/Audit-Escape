# Ideas for more features

## Features
- Audit gets more difficult the more aggression you have
- Workers need to be paid to work (pay every 10 actions, can choose how much to pay, happiness system)
- Multiple variations for audits

### Different types of workers
- Default (make money)
- Manager (boost all other workers)
- Bitcoin Miner (rare, makes a lot of money)
- Spy (makes no money, secret, increases passive suspicion, only when on watchlist)

### Locations
You can buy locations to launder your money. 
You can own multiple locations, but you have to check up on all of them.
Locations have different passive suspicion rates.

### Happiness System
You can choose how much you want to pay your workers. 
If the pay is bad, they will become unhappy.
Unhappy workers will work less and will quit if a certain threshold is reached.

#### Quitting Workers
You will lose this worker and also need to pay a fine. 
The fine needs to be high enough that you don't want your workers to quit
